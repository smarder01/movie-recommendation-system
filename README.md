# PopcornPicks  

A simple **Movie Recommendation System** built using Collaborative Filtering and Matrix Factorization (SVD). This project demonstrates the use of user-based & item-based filtering to provide personalized movie recommendations.

## Features  
- **User-Based Collaborative Filtering** â€“ Recommends movies based on similar users.  
- **Item-Based Collaborative Filtering** â€“ Recommends movies similar to a given movie.  
- **Matrix Factorization (SVD)** â€“ Uses dimensionality reduction to predict ratings.  
- **Evaluation with RMSE** â€“ Measures model accuracy.  
- **Command-Line Interface** â€“ Users can input a movie or user ID to get recommendations.

## Dataset: MovieLens 100K  
This project uses the **MovieLens 100K dataset** provided by [GroupLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/). It contains **100,000 ratings** from **943 users** on **1,682 movies**, with ratings ranging from **1 to 5 stars**.  

### Dataset Files & Structure  
After extraction, the dataset files are located in the `ml-100k/` directory:  

| File           | Description |
|---------------|------------|
| `movies.csv`  | Contains **movieId**, **title**, and **genres**. |
| `ratings.csv` | Contains **userId**, **movieId**, **rating**, and **timestamp** for **100,000 ratings**. |
| `tags.csv`    | Contains user-generated **tags** for movies (e.g., "Action", "Drama"). |
| `README`      | Dataset information provided by GroupLens. |

## Future Enhancements
- Hybrid Model â€“ Combine collaborative and content-based filtering.
- Deep Learning â€“ Use Autoencoders or Transformers for better recommendations.
- Web Interface â€“ Deploy a Streamlit app for a better user experience.
- API Deployment â€“ Use Flask/FastAPI for REST API integration.
